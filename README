# Prerequisites
  * Build pythia6, set the environment variable `PYTHIA6` to point to the directory containing libPythia6.so
  * Install ROOT with pythia6 enabled
  
# Build
  * Make a build directory: `mkdir build; cd build`
  * Configure the build with cmake: `cmake ..`
  * Build: `make`
  * Install: `make install` -- by default this will install to a subdirectory of the build directory named `$(uname)`.
  * To set up the NuWro environment: `source /path/to/build/setup.sh`
  
# Getting events
  * Run nominal NuWro: `nuwro`!
  * Copy /path/to/source/data/params.txt to your working directory and modify as needed.
  * Run NuWro with parameter override: `nuwro -i params.txt`
  * Create an analysis flat tree: `SAF_Analysis -n eventsout.root SAF.eventsout.root`
